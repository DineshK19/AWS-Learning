Using EC2 we can launch three types of service 
1. On Demand Instancs  ---> can we launched at any point of time and deregister at any point of time
2. reserved Instances (Less expensive than On Demand)---> The instance must be used for atleast for an year or 3 yr.
3.Spot Instances (very low cost)---> these are free instances avaiable in aws .cannot be used for critical applications.Need to do bidding ..
